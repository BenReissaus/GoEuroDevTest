# GoEuroDevTest

This repository contains a solution for the dev test posed by the company GoEuro: https://github.com/goeuro/dev-test.
If you want to compile the project yourself use the command "mvn verify" in the root directory. The "target" directory will then contain all class files and the executable jar "GoEuroTest.jar". In case you do not have maven installed, I have supplied the final jar in the root directory. 

The following command should be used to execute: "java -jar GoEuroTest.jar [city_name]". The csv file "data.csv" will be created in the same directory and contain the result.
